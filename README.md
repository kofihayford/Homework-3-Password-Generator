Homework 3 - Password Generator

This homework was by far the most challenging. My understanding of functions and variables and the syntax of both of them fell behind and its taken me many hours of review and study to get a grasp of them. 
I feel that I now have a working understanding of both those concepts. 

The first step I took was to lay the basic foundation of declaring the variables necessary to be able to refer them later. 
I then tried to make sure that the prompts worked. 
Later, I introduced console logs to ensure that the responses were being caputred accurately. 
I experienced some challengs with some things returning undefined. 
After some tweaking, this went away. 
I then started the harder work of calling the functions and using the if, if else, and else conditionals to instruct the app to behave according to the parameters the user wants. 
This required a few different iterations and configurations in terms of placing the statements in different locations in the code to get them to work correctly. 

AFter many hours of working on it I finally have a working app that I'm proud of.
